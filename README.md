# Personal Projects

## Index
This repository holds personal projects that I have worked on. There are three categories:
1) Data Science Projects
	- Projects containing statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, or machine learning
2) Data Analysis Projects
	- Projects containing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3) Libraries
	- Python libraries/scripts I wrote to make tasks easier for projects I work on
