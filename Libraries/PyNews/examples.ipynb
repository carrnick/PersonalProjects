      " Wedbush Securities predicts the tech sector will benefit from a slow thaw in the frosty relations between the U.S. and China. While the firm thinks the long-standing issues around piracy and IP theft are not going away and will be negotiated, ratcheted-down tension between the U.S. and China could be a bullish sign for the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and semi names like Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Analyst Dan Ives: \"We believe much of the risk to semis is behind chip suppliers as companies like TSMC and WDC have pulled Huawei out of their forward estimates. We don't necessarily expect a Biden administration to quickly back away from current policy (e.g. restrictions on Huawei/SMIC/etc.), but we also deem it less likely that we will wake up one morning to suddenly find an additional set of policy restrictions aimed at another leading Chinese tech company. We do see some possibility that restrictions are eventually loosened with regards to SMIC, Huawei, etc., a result that could create winners (semicap equipment, substrate, wafers, certain component suppliers) while pressuring players who have benefitted from share shift away from China's Champions.\" The iShares PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) are a couple of catch-all funds for the $39B semiconductor market.   \n",

      "The Big 6 megacap stocks fell this past week, a big contributor to weekly declines of the S&amp;P (SP500) (NYSEARCA:SPY) and Nasdaq (COMP) (NASDAQ:QQQ).Tesla was the biggest decliner, off 6.12%, with most of the damage coming in a plunge of nearly 8% on Monday from a record high around $880. Facebook followed, falling 6.06%, on pressure on the social media sector as the political firestorm around the platforms continues and confusion about privacy with WhatsApp.Momentum has slowed for every name but Tesla, which is the only stock higher in the past month. But strong quarterly results when the companies report at the end of the month could help these big names regain some traction.One metric to look at for these companies going into reporting is earnings leverage, according to research firm DataTrek.The upshot of the leverage is that the bottom-line rate of change is greater than the top-line rate of change. With quarterly revenue varying, but costs relatively fixed, a rise in revenue should product a bigger rise in earnings (and a drop a bigger decline) when there is leverage.DataTrek looked into leverage for the megacaps, which make up 23% of the S&amp;P, for Q4 and FY21. Excluding Tesla “there isn’t much in the way of earnings leverage at these companies for Q4 (at least as far as the analysts’ estimates go) and only Amazon and TSLA have much of a story to tell in 2021,” co-founders Nicholas Colas and Jessica Rabe write. “That’s important, because earnings leverage is what creates upside earnings surprises.”Breaking down the specific names:Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports Jan. 27, with expected EPS $0.70, revenue $63.3B.Apple’s expected Q4 EPS growth is 12%, vs. revenue growth of 15.7%.Its 2021 EPS growth is 9% vs. 5.3% revenue.No earnings leverage Q4, “but it returns to levels we’d call ‘normal’ in 2021 (earnings growth about 2x revenue growth),” DataTrek says.Seeking Alpha gives the stock a C- for earnings revisions.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports Jan. 26, with expected EPS $1.55 and revenue $35.8B.Microsoft’s expected Q4 EPS growth is 8.6%, revenue 8.9%.Its 2021 EPS growth 10.5%, and 10.9% revenue.“Microsoft is expected to show essentially no earnings leverage in either Q4 or all of 2021,” DataTrek says.Seeking Alpha gives Microsoft a revisions grade of B+.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports Jan. 29, with expected Q4 EPS of $7.53 and revenue of $92.6B.Amazon’s expected Q4 EPS growth comes in at 10.7% and revenue 36.7%.For 2021, EPS growth of 30.1% and revenue growth of 18.4%.“Higher operating costs around the Holidays likely crimped AMZN’s operating leverage in Q4, but 2021 looks like what you’d expect with roughly 2x earnings growth versus sales growth,” DataTrek says.Amazon receives a C+ on earnings revisions from Seeking Alpha.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports Feb. 4, with expected Q4 EPS of $11.20, revenue of $42.9B.Its expected Q4 EPS growth is 2.6% on revenue growth of 15.2%.For 2021 earnings growth is at 18.7%, revenue at 21.2%.“Google has the worst (most negative) earnings leverage in Q4 2020 and only returns to zero leverage (still not great) in 2021,” DataTrek says.Alphabet has a Seeking Alpha revisions grade of B-.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reports Jan. 27, Q4 EPS expected $0.60, revenue $8.3B.The expected Q4 EPS growth is 131.7% and revenue of growth of 38.1%.For 2021 its EPS of 70.9% and revenue 47.3%.These “wildly positive earnings leverage ratios (2-4x earnings growth/sales growth) are emblematic of a traditional manufacturing company as it ramps production,” DataTrek says.Tesla rates a C on earnings revisions from Seeking Alpha.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports Jan. 27, Q4 EPS expectations of $1.91 and revenue $19.8B.Q4 EPS expected growth of 24.6%, with revenue of 24.7%.For 2021, EPS of 12.3% and revenue of 23.9%.The fourth quarter “isn’t awful for Facebook in terms of earnings leverage (flat), but Wall Street is clearly unsure just how much - if any - earnings leverage this company really has in 2021,” according to DataTrek.Facebook gets a Seeking Alpha revisions grade of B.“Make no mistake, however - these are all excellent companies with strong competitive positions and even stronger free cash flow in most cases.”Seeking Alpha contributor Nikolaos Sismanis laid out his case yesterday on why Facebook is “grossly undervalued” and a generational buying opportunity. \n",

      "   Alongside news today that it's exploring a subscription podcasting service, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it would re-close its retail stores in Texas, North Carolina and Georgia.    That's due to spikes in cases of COVID-19, the company says. The closures cover about 22 locations.    Also, Apple is planning the first redesign of its iMac all-in-one personal computer in at least eight years, Bloomberg reports.    That coincides with the company's move toward using its own Apple Silicon to replace processors made by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).    The new iMacs will reportedly have a smaller bezel (the border around the screen, and the aluminum \"chin\" beneath the screen).    There are reports that Apple will produce new MacBook Pros in 14 and 16 inches with MagSafe charging returning. And a new Mac Pro will feature an Apple-designed system-on-a-chip but at half the height of the current Mac Pro. \n",

That marks a bigger move from Apple, which has been quietly expanding its efforts in the space over the past few years. It already runs the most widely used podcasting app in the industry.    Any new Apple service also has implications for rivals who have acquired podcasting productions in the last few years, including Amazon.com (AMZN -0.5%; which acquired Wondery) and Sirius XM (SIRI -0.2%; which bought Stitcher).    Spotify had fallen earlier this morning in the wake of a cut to Sell at Citi, with specific concerns about whether the \"podcast pivot\" was driving subs. \n",

      "The Trump administration has added smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTCPK:XIACY, OTCPK:XIACF) to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, sending its Hong Kong-listed shares down 10.6% on Friday. The move means that Xiaomi is now subject to a November executive order restricting American investors from buying the company's shares or related securities.Statement from the DoD: \"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People's Republic of China's Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People’s Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities.\"Response from Xiaomi: \"The company reiterates that it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use. The company confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a 'Communist Chinese Military Company' defined under the NDAA.\"Xiaomi's stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months and it has been rapidly gaining market share. In the third quarter of 2020, it surpassed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the world's third-largest smartphone maker, according to Gartner and Counterpoint Research.Go deeper: Xiaomi has not been put on the Commerce Department's Entity List, which restricts companies from exporting U.S.-origin technology to firms without a license. That means Xiaomi will be able to continue using chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and the Android operating system (GOOG, GOOGL).Recent reports from the WSJ suggested that Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) have been spared from the Defense Department's blacklist.\n",

      "   A look ahead to 2021 in IT hardware has Barclays staying Neutral on the group, though alongside some upgrades, its ratings on the sector are growing more positive.    It was a group with mixed results in 2020, analyst Tim Long notes, with the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting some names while hurting others.    About half the companies saw revenue prospects improve after initial lockdowns, Barclays notes: Leading the way there were Ubiquiti (NYSE:UI), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Corning (NYSE:GLW), to the benefit of their stock prices. But most enterprise names saw negative impact, it notes (see Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET)).    And P/E multiples expanded for most of the companies, even if they're still below three-year average relative valuations. \"We think fundamentals will matter\" in 2021 amid a broad lift from a macro recovery.    Three names win upgrades to Overweight and price target increases from Barclays: Corning's target is raised to $44 from $31, implying 16% upside; it sees strength across the company's businesses, with Display the most favorable in the near term. Juniper Networks' (NYSE:JNPR) price target goes to $28 from $24, implying 16% more upside; Barclays is looking for that upside from WLAN, metro routing and Cloud.    And Casa Systems' (NASDAQ:CASA) target rises to $9 from $6, implying 14% upside: \"We like the diversification, execution and operating leverage.\"    Moving toward its more lukewarm feelings: Apple continued a strong run in 2020, with revenue upside split pretty evenly between iPhone revenues and strong Macs/iPads on the at-home dynamics. And Barclays' worries about valuation came alongside a year of about 50% multiple expansion, \"so it is becoming more clear that traditional valuation approaches are less meaningful.\"    So it's moving to valuing Apple relative to other mega-cap techs, most of which are in software/Internet. And it's expecting strong fundamentals for the first half before headwinds (including tough comps) pile up in the second.    Barclays is increasing that price target to $116, but that implies 10% downside this year. \"We missed AAPL stock again in 2020 as we did not envision another year of massive P/E multiple expansion,\" it says, but it sees less scope for further expansion from these levels.    It's downgrading HP (NYSE:HPQ) to Underweight from Equal Weight: Though its stock and fundamentals got a lift from work-from-home dynamics, Barclays sees \"secular headwinds\" in the PC and printing businesses from 2021 on.    And Ubiquiti also benefited from WFH, as well as a telco rebound, but its valuation seems \"extended,\" and it should see market share stabilization from hotter competition in WLAN. It rates the stock Underweight with a $174 price target, suggesting some 28% downside ahead. \n",
